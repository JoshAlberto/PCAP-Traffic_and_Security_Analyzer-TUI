# PCAP-Traffic_and_Security_Analyzer-TUI
Terminal-based network traffic and security analysis tool built with Python and Urwid. It reads PCAP/PCAPNG files using PyShark and provides packet inspection, traffic statistics, and basic security detection (port scans, DoS/DDoS, ICMP/ARP anomalies) through an interactive TUI with configurable thresholds.
